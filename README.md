- Full-Stack Web Application:
 Combining these technologies results in a full-stack web application that delivers a rich, interactive user interface, real-time data updates, and robust data storage. Users can interact with the application seamlessly, thanks to React and React Router, while Firebase and MongoDB power the backend, ensuring data integrity and security.
